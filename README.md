# Internship-Tasks
This is one of the tasks given to us in the internship we are doing with The Sparks Foundation i.e GRIP(Graduate Rotational Internship Program )

# Task1
## Prediction using Supervised ML 
● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

● This is a simple linear  regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● Dataset : http://bit.ly/w-data 

# Task2
## Prediction using Unsupervised ML 
● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of  clusters and represent it visually. 

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

# Task 3
## Exploratory Data Analysis 
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset  ‘SampleSuperstore’

● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. 

● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the  data?

# Task 4
## Exploratory Data Analysis-Terrorism
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset  ‘Global Terrorism’ 

● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.

● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

# Task 5
## Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports 
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset  ‘Indian Premier League’ 

● As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team.

● Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products.

● Dataset:https://bit.ly/34SRn3b

# Task 6
## Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm 
● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this  classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
